Hello Quarto World!

## Figures and cross referencing

You can cross reference figures and tables easily. See for example @fig-plot, or if this figure was in the supplementary, you could add a custom prefix and cite it as [Figure S @fig-plot] .

You can also cross reference chapters, for example with a hyper link like [this](#sec-appendix), or directly, like @sec-appendix.

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot
#| fig-cap: "This is a figure caption"
#| echo: true

plot(cars)
```

Here's a simple markdown generated table [@tbl-myTable]:

| Animal | Colour  | Size |
|--------|---------|------|
| Bear   | Brown   | Big  |
| Wolf   | Grey    | Big  |
| Lynx   | Orange? | Big  |

: My Table {#tbl-myTable}

For adding reference, quarto work great with Zotero. If you are in RStudio, just type \\\@ and you will be able to search your Zotero library. When you add a reference, it will automatically be added to the `references.bib` file. Here's a reference to a paper [@arvesen2018].
