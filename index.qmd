Welcome splash page! Provide an overview of the book.

Sample evaluation of R and Python in a side-by-side manner:

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
#### R

```{r}
my_list = list(1, 2, 3)
typeof(my_list)
```

#### Python

```{python}
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
type(my_list)
```

See [Chapter 1](#sec-hello-world) for how to plot and cross reference figures. We cannot make cross referanceble objects on this page, because it is an *unnumbered* page, and you can't cross reference to things in unnumbered pages.
